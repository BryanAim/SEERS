        <p> The HIV SEERs Project is a global community-based participatory research project designed to reduce HIV
          stigma among
          youth, which is a known barrier to HIV testing and treatment. HIV continues to be a very real problem in the
          United
          States and across the world, particularly in low- to-middle incomes. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa carries
          70% of the
          disease burden of HIV. HIV disproportionately affects minorities and the poor, and youth are at significant
          risk for
          contracting HIV. Approximately one in four new HIV infections is among youth aged 13-24. Understanding that
          HIV is a
          global disease requiring global solutions and with initial funding from a Pediatric HIV Global Research Grant,
          Dr.
          Chenneville designed the HIV SEERs Project as a means by which to educate and empower youth to create
          sustainable change
          within their communities.</p>

    <h2 id="WWD">What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      In July 2016, Dr. Chenneville traveled to Kenya where she completed a train-the-trainers workshop on the HIV SEERs
      Project. She trained four teams comprised of approximately 30 adults and youth ages 13-24, many of whom are HIV
      positive
      and/or are personally affected by HIV. Since the training, the teams have delivered the program, collectively, to
      over
      2,000 youth in local schools and churches in the city of Nakuru. The program involves 4 components:
      <ul>
        <li>Educating youth
          about HIV and HIV-related stigma;</li>
        <li>Teaching youth communication and negotiation skills needed to prevent HIV
          transmission and combat HIV-related stigma;</li>
        <li>Providing resources and support related to HIV prevention and treatment;
          and</li>
        <li>Sharing personal stories of how HIV has affected their lives.</li>
      </ul> The personal story piece is particularly important
      because we know from existing research that interacting with others from a disenfranchised or “out” group can
      increase empathy and reduce stigma. By
      all accounts, the HIV SEERs Project appears to be having a significant impact on the lives of young people in
      Kenya.
      Heads of schools are asking teams to return and provide more programming, and community groups are inviting teams
      to
      deliver the program in a variety of forums. In addition to the positive change teams are creating in their
      community,
      team members are reporting the value of their involvement with the HIV SEERs Project as evident in the quotes
      below.

    <p>
      Dr. Chenneville is collecting data to document the impact of the HIV SEERs Project with the hope of obtaining
      federal
      funding to not only expand the project in Kenya by helping teams to further mobilize and create change within
      their
      community, but also to replicate the project in other communities and countries, to include the United States. The
      long-term goal of the HIV SEERs Project is to develop an HIV youth ambassador program whereby youth from across
      the
      world can come together to develop and deliver cross-cultural peer-led HIV initiatives. The HIV SEERs Project is
      built
      on the belief that we can empower youth with and without HIV to join together to end AIDS. Currently, Dr.
      Chenneville is
      seeking bridge funding to maintain the HIV SEERs Project in Kenya while she seeks federal support to realize the
      long-term vision of this initiative.</p>
    <p>For more information about the HIV SEERs Project, please contact Dr. Tiffany
      Chenneville at 727-873-4584 or chennevi@mail.usf.edu. Dr. Chenneville is an Associate Professor of Psychology at
      the
      University of South Florida St. Petersburg. She has been conducting HIV research for over 20 years.
